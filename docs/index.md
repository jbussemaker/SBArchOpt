# SBArchOpt: Surrogate-Based Architecture Optimization

SBArchOpt (es-bee-ARK-opt) provides a set of classes and interfaces for applying Surrogate-Based Optimization (SBO)
for system architecture optimization problems:

- Expensive black-box problems: evaluating one candidate architecture might computationally expensive
- Mixed-discrete design variables: categorical architectural decisions mixed with continuous sizing variables
- Hierarchical design variables: decisions can deactivate/activate (parts of) downstream decisions
- Multi-objective: stemming from conflicting stakeholder needs
- Subject to hidden constraints: simulation tools might not converge for all design points

Surrogate-Based Optimization (SBO) aims to accelerate convergence by fitting a surrogate model
(e.g. regression, gaussian process, neural net) to the inputs (design variables) and outputs (objectives/constraints)
to try to predict where interesting infill points lie. Potentially, SBO needs about one or two orders of magnitude less
function evaluations than Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEA's) like NSGA2. However, dealing with the
specific challenges of architecture optimization, especially in a combination of the challenges, is not trivial.
This library hopes to support in doing this.

The library provides:

- A common interface for defining architecture optimization problems based on [pymoo](https://pymoo.org/)
- Sampling and correction algorithms for hierarchical design spaces
- Support in using Surrogate-Based Optimization (SBO) algorithms:
  - Implementation of a basic SBO algorithm
  - Connectors to various external SBO libraries
- Analytical and realistic test problems that exhibit one or more of the architecture optimization challenges

### Connecting to Optimization Frameworks

Interfaces to optimization frameworks are located in the `sb_arch_opt.algo` module.
Each framework has a dedicated readme file with instructions on how to use and how to install the framework:

- [pymoo](algo/pymoo.md): evolutionary optimization framework with state-of-the-art (multi-objective) algorithms
- [ArchSBO](algo/arch_sbo.md): SBO implementation for architecture optimization in this repository
- [BoTorch (Ax)](algo/botorch.md): Bayesian Optimization framework based on PyTorch developed by Meta
- [Trieste](algo/trieste.md): Bayesian Optimization framework based on Tensorflow developed by Secondmind Labs
- [HEBO](algo/hebo.md): Bayesian Optimization algorithm developed by Huawei Noahs Ark DMnR lab
- [TPE](algo/tpe.md): Tree Parzen Estimator algorithm
- [Egor](algo/egor.md): SBO algorithm written in Rust developed by ONERA

Following proprietary frameworks are also integrated:

- [SEGOMOE](algo/segomoe.md): SBO algorithm with Mixture of Experts developed by ONERA and ISAE-SUPAERO
- [SMARTy](algo/smarty.md): surrogate modeling toolbox with SBO functionality developed by the DLR

Optimization framework dependencies (except pymoo) are always optional! Therefore, when installing SBArchOpt, the
interfaces to optimization frameworks are probably not working yet.

### Test Problems

[Overview of Test Problems in SBArchOpt](test_problems.md)

### Implementing an Architecture Optimization Problem

To implement an architecture optimization problem, create a new class extending the `ArchOptProblemBase` class.
You then need to implement the following functionality:

- Design variable definition in the `__init__` function using `Variable` classes (in `pymoo.core.variable`)
- Evaluation of a design vector in `_arch_evaluate`
- Correction (imputation/repair) of a design vector in `_correct_x`
  - Note that this function is only used if `all_discrete_x` (as returned by `_gen_all_discrete_x`) is not available
    or  `design_space.use_auto_correction` is set to `False`
- Return which variables are conditionally active in `_is_conditionally_active`
- An (optional) interface for implementing intermediate storage of problem-specific results (`store_results`), and
  restarting an optimization from these previous results (`load_previous_results`)
- A unique class representation in `__repr__`

Design variables of different types are defined as follows:

- Continuous (`Real`): any value between some lower and upper bound (inclusive)
  --> for example [0, 1]: 0, 0.25, .667, 1
- Integer (`Integer` or `Binary`): integer between 0 and some upper bound (inclusive); ordering and distance matters
  --> for example [0, 2]: 0, 1, 2
- Categorical (`Choice`): one of n options, encoded as integers; ordering and distance are not defined
  --> for example [red, blue, yellow]: red, blue (to get associated categorical values, use `get_categorical_values`)

The input to the `_arch_evaluate` function has not yet been imputed (however discrete variables have been rounded and
therefore have integer values). Output of the evaluation should be provided as follows:

- Objective function `f` as minimization
- Inequality constraints `g` according to `g(x) <= 0` means "satisfied"
- Equality constraints `h` according to `h(x) = 0` means "satisfied"

Note: if you are implementing a test problem where it is relatively cheap to determine the "real" Pareto front, you
may use the `sb_arch_opt.pareto_front.CachedParetoFrontMixin` mixin. This mixin adds functions for automatically finding
the Pareto front, so the `pareto_front()` function can be used.

Example:

```python
import numpy as np
from typing import List
from sb_arch_opt.problem import ArchOptProblemBase
from sb_arch_opt.pareto_front import CachedParetoFrontMixin
from pymoo.core.variable import Real, Integer, Choice

### Architecture Optimization Problem with an Explicit Design Space Model

If you are implementing an architecture optimization problem with design space hierarchy (i.e. some of your design
variables are conditionally active), you could instead of implementing the `_correct_x` function yourself, also specify
the hierarchical structure explicitly using `ExplicitArchDesignSpace`. To do this, you have to specify:
1. Design variables using `ContinuousParam`, `IntegerParam`, or `CategoricalParam` (note: these are different classes
   than when you use the pymoo API for the implicit formulation above!)
2. Conditions specifying which design variable is active at which condition
3. Optionally, you can also add value constraints, which explicitly forbid some condition, such as the simultaneous
   occurrence of two design variable options

You can then pass the explicit design space definition as the first argument to the `ArchOptProblemBase` class.
Example usage:
```python
import numpy as np
from sb_arch_opt.design_space_explicit import *
from sb_arch_opt.problem import ArchOptProblemBase


class DemoExplicitArchOptProblem(ArchOptProblemBase):
    """
    An example of an architecture problem implementation using an explicit design space definition.
    Using this, there is no need to implement _correct_x, _get_n_valid_discrete, and _gen_all_discrete_x.
    """

    def __init__(self):
        # Specify a design space with a categorical, an integer, and a continuous variable
        ds = ExplicitArchDesignSpace([
            CategoricalParam('cat', ['A', 'B', 'C']),
            IntegerParam('int', 0, 3),
            ContinuousParam('cont', 0, 1),
        ])
        
        # Activate int and cont conditionally
        ds.add_conditions([
            InCondition(ds['int'], ds['cat'], ['A', 'B']),  # Activate int if cat == A or cat == B
            EqualsCondition(ds['cont'], ds['cat'], 'A'),  # Activate cont if cat == A
        ])
        
        # Explicitly forbid int from being 3 if cat == B
        # You can also specify the values as a list to constrain more than one value at a time
        ds.add_value_constraint(ds['int'], 3, ds['cat'], 'B')
        
        super().__init__(ds, n_obj=1)

    def _arch_evaluate(self, x: np.ndarray, is_active_out: np.ndarray, f_out: np.ndarray, g_out: np.ndarray,
                       h_out: np.ndarray, *args, **kwargs):
        """
        Implement evaluation and write results in the provided output matrices:

        - g (inequality constraints): written as "<= 0"

        For the explicit design space definition, x and is_active_out are already imputed. If anything is wrong, then
        you should change the design space definition rather than trying to fix it here.

    def __repr__(self):
        """repr() of the class, should be unique for unique Pareto fronts"""
        return f'{self.__class__.__name__}()'
```

Under the hood, the explicit design space definition uses [ConfigSpace](https://automl.github.io/ConfigSpace/), a
library for modeling hierarchical design spaces.

## Architecture Optimization Measures

To increase the efficiency (and in some cases make it possible at all) of architecture optimization problems, several
measures have been identified. Each of these measures can be implemented independently, however the more, the better.
Architecture optimization aspects and mitigation measures:

| Aspect                  | Problem-level                                                  | MOEA                                       | SBO                                                                                                                  |

| Multi-objective (MO)    |                                                                | Prioritize w.r.t. distance to Pareto front | Multi-objective infill criteria                                                                                      |
| Hierarchical (HIER)     | Imputation; activeness; design space def; low imputation ratio | Impute during sampling, evaluation         | Impute during sampling, evaluation, infill search; hierarchical kernels; design space def; discard non-canonical DVs |
| Hidden constraints (HC) | Catch errors and return NaN                                    | Extreme barrier approach                   | Process NaNs; predict hidden constraints area                                                                        |
| Expensive (EXP)         | Support parallel evaluation                                    | Same as for SBO                            | Intermediate results storage; resuming optimizations; ask-tell interface; batch infill                               |
