    Get an architecture SBO algorithm using a mixed-discrete Gaussian Process (Kriging) model as its surrogate model.
    Appropriate (multi-objective) infills and constraint handling techniques are automatically selected.

    For constraint handling, increase min_pof to between 0.50 and 0.75 to be more conservative (i.e. require a higher
    probability of being feasible for infill points) or decrease below 0.50 to be more exploratory. Optionally defined
    an aggregation strategy to reduce the number of models to train.

    To reduce model training times for high-dimensional problems, KPLS is used instead of Kriging when the problem
    dimension exceeds kpls_n_dim. Note that the DoE should then contain at least kpls_n_dim+1 points.
